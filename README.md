# Lab 7 - Layout
This webpage shows a fake hot air balloon site.

## Development
It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

## How to run the site
Select the index.html file within VSCode
Press ctrl+shift+p or cmd+shift+p to open the command palette
Run the command 'Live Preview: Start Server' to start the server
The website is viewable locally via the link http://127.0.0.1:3000/
